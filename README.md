# Steering control using CNN
This repository contains code to train a car to steer in a simulated environment using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The simulator used to collect the trainind data and test the model is Udacity's self-driving car simulator. This was the term-end project for the ENPM690-Robot Learning course.

This project is the implementation of NVIDIA's paper End to End Learning for Self Driving Cars
